<h1> CCAP - CryptoCurrency Alias Protocol </h1>

<p>
CCAP is a protocol that defines the standard by which cryptocurrency wallets can communicate with servers to relate aliases to cryptocurrency addresses. The protocol allows for the decentralization of the alias --> address relationship. Anyone can use the protocol to build/host their own server on their own domain. Servers can be majorly centralized, or individuals can run their own servers, much like SMTP (email).

<h2> Anatomy of an Alias </h2>
<h3>@{username}.{domain name}</h3>
<p> We decided to put the @ symbol out in front to not confuse aliases with email addresses. </p>
<p> Because CCAP is a REST-based protocol, the only information necessary in the alias is the domain where a user's address information is stored, and a username so that multiple users can have addresses on a single domain.
